# ESP32-S3 Stepper Controller

This project uses an **ESP32-S3 WROOM (Freenove board)** with a **TMC2209 stepper driver**, rotary encoder (jog wheel), and buttons to control a stepper motor. It also integrates **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** for future expansion.

---

## Features

* Control stepper motor direction and speed with a jog wheel (rotary encoder)
* Press jog encoder for **continuous forward run** until released
* Dedicated button for additional stepper actions
* BLE server code included for future remote control and monitoring
* Designed for **Freenove ESP32-S3 board** with pins optimized for working peripherals

## Hardware Used

* [Freenove ESP32-S3 WROOM Board](https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_ESP32_S3_WROOM)
* [TMC2209 Stepper Driver](https://www.trinamic.com/products/integrated-circuits/details/tmc2209/)
* NEMA 17 Stepper Motor (or similar)
* Rotary encoder (jog wheel with push button)
* Extra push button for motor control

## Wiring Overview

| Component          | ESP32-S3 Pin        |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Stepper DIR        | GPIO 12             |
| Stepper STEP       | GPIO 14             |
| Stepper ENABLE     | GPIO 27             |
| Jog Encoder A      | GPIO 4              |
| Jog Encoder B      | GPIO 5              |
| Jog Encoder Button | GPIO 15             |
| Extra Button       | GPIO 21 (suggested) |

*(You can adjust pins in `main.cpp` as needed.)*

---

## Usage

1. Rotate the jog encoder â†’ Stepper moves relative to rotation
2. Press jog encoder â†’ Stepper runs continuously forward until released
3. Press extra button â†’ Custom stepper action (e.g., reverse jog or home)

Serial Monitor output will confirm encoder and button activity.
