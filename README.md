# Drip Prototyping Board

**WARNING --** A bug was found in the original script that causes the Auto button to not work after holding and releasing the Manual knob.  Update to the latest version, or as a workaround, make a manual adjustment by *turning* the Manual knob before pressing the Auto button.

This project uses an **ESP32-S3 WROOM (Freenove board)** with a **TMC2209 stepper driver**, to test using a peristaltic pump to create drips with precise timing.

---

## Features

* Adjust speed and distance for single "auto" drip, then press Auto button.  Ideally, this button will drop a single drip and prep the next drip.
* Manually move stepper motor forward or back to prep the next drip test (press Manual knob to run forward until released)

## Hardware Used

* [Freenove ESP32-S3 WROOM Board](https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_ESP32_S3_WROOM)
* [TMC2209 Stepper Driver](https://www.trinamic.com/products/integrated-circuits/details/tmc2209/)
* NEMA 17 Stepper Motor (or similar)
* Rotary encoders (jog wheel with push button)
* Push button for motor control

| ------------------ | ------------ |
| Manual Knob A      | GPIO 1       |
| Manual Knob B      | GPIO 2       |
| Speed Knob A       | GPIO 42      |
| Speed Knob B       | GPIO 41      |
| Distance Knob A    | GPIO 48      |
| Distance Knob B    | GPIO 47      |
| Auto Button        | GPIO 21      |
| Driver - Step      | GPIO 4       |
| Driver - Direction | GPIO 5       |
| Driver - Enable    | GPIO 15      |
| Driver - RX        | GPIO 16      |
| Driver - RX        | GPIO 17      |

## Usage

1. Rotate or Hold the Manual Knob â†’ Stepper moves relative to rotation - Prep a drop
2. Adjust Speed and Distance encoder knobs as desired
3. Press Auto button â†’ Stepper runs selected Distance at selected Speed

Serial Monitor output will confirm encoder and button activity.

Values are stored in the ESP32's memory, so testing can be done without a computer and later plugged into a serial monitor to read Speed/Distance values.

Here is the wiring for the stepper motor.  These connections are more fragile than I expected...

## Next Steps

* ðŸ”² Try IR drip sensor to auto prep a drip
* ðŸ”² Test with smaller/cheaper servos
