# ESP32-S3 Stepper Controller

This project uses an **ESP32-S3 WROOM (Freenove board)** with a **TMC2209 stepper driver**, rotary encoder (jog wheel), and buttons to control a stepper motor.

---

## Features

* Adjust speed and distance for single "auto" drip, then press Auto button
* Manually control stepper motor direction and speed with a jog wheel
* Press jog wheel for **continuous forward run** until released

---

## Hardware Used

* [Freenove ESP32-S3 WROOM Board](https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_ESP32_S3_WROOM)
* [TMC2209 Stepper Driver](https://www.trinamic.com/products/integrated-circuits/details/tmc2209/)
* NEMA 17 Stepper Motor (or similar)
* Rotary encoder (jog wheel with push button)
* Extra push button for motor control

## Wiring Overview

| Component          | ESP32-S3 Pin        |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Stepper DIR        | GPIO 12             |
| Stepper STEP       | GPIO 14             |
| Stepper ENABLE     | GPIO 27             |
| Jog Encoder A      | GPIO 4              |
| Jog Encoder B      | GPIO 5              |
| Jog Encoder Button | GPIO 15             |
| Extra Button       | GPIO 21 (suggested) |

*(You can adjust pins in `main.cpp` as needed.)*

## Usage

1. Rotate or Hold the Manual Knob â†’ Stepper moves relative to rotation - Prep a drop
2. Adjust Speed and Distance encoder knobs as desired
3. Press Auto button â†’ Stepper runs selected Distance at selected Speed

Serial Monitor output will confirm encoder and button activity.
